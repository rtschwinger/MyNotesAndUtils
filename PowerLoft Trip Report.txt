The problem looks to be with the query server( possibly a memory leak ).
I am currently attempting to detatch the database.
This will take some time based on the size of the database.
Currently all data is intact and we also have a complete backup of the database from the scheduled backup

All data is now coming in for the past two days and back to the 15th.
